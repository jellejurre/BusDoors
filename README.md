## How to run
You can run the julia files with the `julia --project=. [file to run]` command. This will use the Project.toml and Manifest.toml to do dependency resolution. If you want to add new dependencies to the project, you can do so by typing `activate .` in the julia REPL package manager, and any new packages you add will be added to the .toml files.
